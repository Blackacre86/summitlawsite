          <h3>Our Defense Approach</h3>
          <p>
            When defending against property crime charges, we employ a comprehensive strategy:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Evidence examination</strong> - Scrutinizing surveillance footage, witness statements, physical evidence, and digital records</li>
            <li><strong>Intent challenges</strong> - Questioning the prosecution's ability to prove criminal intent</li>
            <li><strong>Value assessment</strong> - Challenging property valuations that may affect charge severity</li>
            <li><strong>Ownership disputes</strong> - Examining questions of actual property ownership or authorization</li>
            <li><strong>Mistaken identity defense</strong> - Establishing potential misidentification when relevant</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>The Former Prosecutor Advantage</h3>
          <p>
            Our experience as former prosecutors gives us unique insight into how property crime cases are built and prosecuted. We understand common weaknesses in these cases and how to effectively challenge the evidence against you.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Alternative Resolutions</h3>
          <p>
            For many property crimes, especially first offenses, we can often negotiate alternatives to criminal conviction:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Pretrial diversion programs</li>
            <li>Civil restitution agreements</li>
            <li>Probation without a finding</li>
            <li>Community service arrangements</li>
            <li>Reduced charges</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Protecting Your Future</h3>
          <p>
            Property crime convictions can have lasting consequences on your ability to find employment, secure housing, and maintain professional licenses. We work diligently to protect your future by seeking the best possible outcome for your specific situation.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Strategic Defense Options</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on the circumstances of your case, we may implement various defense strategies:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
