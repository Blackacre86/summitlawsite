          <h2>Fighting OUI/DUI Charges in Massachusetts</h2>
          <p>
            At Summit Law, we understand that facing an OUI/DUI charge can be overwhelming. These cases often involve complex scientific and legal issues that require expert representation from an attorney experienced in this specific area of law.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Our OUI/DUI Defense Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            Our approach to OUI/DUI defense is methodical and comprehensive. As former prosecutors, we know exactly how the Commonwealth builds these cases and where to look for weaknesses. Our defense strategy includes:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Thorough evidence review</strong> - We meticulously examine all evidence, from field sobriety tests to breathalyzer results</li>
            <li><strong>Procedural analysis</strong> - We ensure all police procedures followed proper protocol and constitutional requirements</li>
            <li><strong>Scientific challenge</strong> - We question the reliability and accuracy of chemical testing</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative explanations</strong> - We develop explanations for symptoms that police interpreted as intoxication</li>
            <li><strong>Negotiation expertise</strong> - When appropriate, we negotiate for reduced charges or alternative disposition</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Consequences of OUI/DUI Convictions</h3>
          <p>
            Massachusetts OUI/DUI convictions carry serious penalties that can impact your life for years to come:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>License suspension (from 45 days to lifetime revocation)</li>
            <li>Fines and court fees (potentially thousands of dollars)</li>
            <li>Mandatory alcohol education programs</li>
            <li>Potential jail time</li>
            <li>Criminal record affecting employment and housing</li>
            <li>Increased insurance rates</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>How Our Former Prosecutor Experience Benefits You</h3>
          <p>
            Having worked as prosecutors, our attorneys have specialized knowledge of how OUI/DUI cases are built and prosecuted. This insider perspective allows us to identify weaknesses in the prosecution's case that others might miss, from improper stops to flawed field sobriety testing.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Common Defense Strategies We Employ</h3>
          <p>
            Every OUI/DUI case is unique, but some common defense strategies we use include:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Challenging the legality of the initial traffic stop</li>
            <li>Questioning the administration and interpretation of field sobriety tests</li>
            <li>Contesting the accuracy and reliability of breathalyzer results</li>
            <li>Presenting alternative explanations for observed symptoms</li>
            <li>Identifying procedural errors in the arrest and booking process</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            At Summit Law, we fight to minimize the impact of OUI/DUI charges on your life. Our goal is always the best possible outcome for your specific situation.
