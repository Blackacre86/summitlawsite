          <h2>Domestic Violence Defense in Massachusetts</h2>
          <p>
            Domestic violence allegations are among the most sensitive and potentially damaging charges a person can face. Beyond the legal consequences, they can significantly impact your family relationships, employment, housing options, and reputation in the community.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Understanding Domestic Violence Cases</h3>
          <p>
            In Massachusetts, domestic violence encompasses various charges when they involve family or household members:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Assault and battery</li>
            <li>Assault with a dangerous weapon</li>
            <li>Kidnapping</li>
            <li>Criminal harassment</li>
            <li>Stalking</li>
            <li>Violation of restraining orders (209A orders)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Our Strategic Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Our defense strategy begins with a comprehensive understanding of your case:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Detailed case analysis</strong> - Examining all evidence, witness statements, and police reports</li>
            <li><strong>Context investigation</strong> - Understanding the full context and history of the relationship</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence gathering</strong> - Collecting exculpatory evidence including texts, emails, and witness testimony</li>
            <li><strong>Expert consultation</strong> - Working with experts when necessary to challenge prosecution evidence</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>The Prosecutor Advantage</h3>
          <p>
            Having served as prosecutors, our attorneys understand exactly how domestic violence cases are built and what evidence prosecutors rely on most heavily. We know that these cases often hinge on credibility, and we work diligently to uncover inconsistencies and alternative narratives that support your defense.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Restraining Orders and Civil Consequences</h3>
          <p>
            We also represent clients in 209A restraining order hearings. These civil proceedings can result in significant restrictions even without criminal charges. Our attorneys provide strong advocacy to protect your rights during these crucial hearings.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Discreet and Compassionate Representation</h3>
          <p>
            We understand the sensitive nature of domestic violence allegations and provide discreet, compassionate representation throughout the legal process. Our goal is to achieve the best possible legal outcome while minimizing impact on your life and relationships.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If you're facing domestic violence allegations, time is of the essence. Early intervention can significantly impact the trajectory of your case.
