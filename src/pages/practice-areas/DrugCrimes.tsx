          <h2>Drug Crime Defense in Massachusetts</h2>

          </p>
          
          <h3>Types of Drug Cases We Handle</h3>

          <ul>

          </ul>
          
          <h3>Our Defense Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Our strategy in drug cases focuses on several key areas:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Constitutional challenges</strong> - Examining search and seizure issues, warrant requirements, and privacy violations</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence analysis</strong> - Challenging the prosecution's evidence regarding possession, intent, and drug identification</li>
            <li><strong>Scientific scrutiny</strong> - Questioning lab procedures, chain of custody, and testing protocols</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative resolutions</strong> - Pursuing diversion programs, treatment options, and other alternatives to incarceration when appropriate</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>The Former Prosecutor Advantage</h3>
          <p>
            Our experience as former prosecutors gives us unique insight into how drug cases are built and prosecuted. We understand the pressure points in these cases and how to effectively challenge the evidence and legal theories presented by the Commonwealth.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Strategic Defense Options</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on the circumstances of your case, we may implement various defense strategies:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Motion to suppress evidence obtained through illegal searches</li>
            <li>Challenging constructive possession allegations</li>
            <li>Disproving intent to distribute elements</li>
            <li>Questioning the reliability of confidential informants</li>
            <li>Demonstrating entrapment or other police misconduct</li>
            <li>Negotiating for reduced charges or diversion programs</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Collateral Consequences</h3>
          <p>
            We also help clients understand and mitigate the collateral consequences of drug charges, including effects on:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Professional licenses</li>
