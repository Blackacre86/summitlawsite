              Joe earned his Bachelor's degree in American Government from Suffolk University in 2009. After graduation, he worked in the Massachusetts legislature and served as an independent political consultant, advising local, congressional, and statewide political campaigns throughout New England.

              In 2016, Joe received his Juris Doctor from Massachusetts School of Law. He subsequently joined the Berkshire District Attorney's Office, specializing in domestic violence cases and serving as the District Court Domestic Violence Supervisor. Joe prosecuted numerous cases in both district and superior courts. In 2022, he was selected for advanced investigative and prosecutorial training through the National District Attorneys Association in Arizona. During his tenure as an ADA in the Berkshires, Joe secured a landmark conviction in a complex domestic violence case. He obtained a five-year sentence by successfully stacking multiple charges, significantly exceeding the district court's standard maximum sentence of two and a half years. This case represented one of the most successful evidence-based prosecutions without a witness in county history and set a new standard for prosecutorial effectiveness.
