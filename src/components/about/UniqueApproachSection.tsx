            <p className="text-lg">
              Summit Law employs a strategic and proactive approach to criminal defense that fully utilizes Attorney Joe Brava's background as a former prosecutor and his deep understanding of law enforcement investigations.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg">
              Rather than merely responding to charges or reacting to the prosecution's moves, Joe begins every case by thinking strategically like a prosecutor and analytically like an investigator. He carefully reconstructs the police investigation, scrutinizing how evidence was collected and evaluating investigative methods. Joe identifies any potential mistakes, oversights, or shortcuts taken by law enforcement and assesses the reasoning behind prosecutorial charging decisions.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg">
              Before formulating a defense, Joe attempts to build the prosecution's case himself from their perspective. This reverse-engineering approach systematically reveals flaws in the evidence and investigative methods used by law enforcement. Only after this comprehensive analysis does Joe develop a customized defense strategy specifically designed to leverage those identified weaknesses, ensuring the best possible outcomes for his clients.

            <p className="text-lg">

All technological solutions adhere to strict standards of security and confidentiality.
