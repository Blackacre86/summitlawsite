              I employ a strategic and proactive approach to criminal defense that fully utilizes my background as a former prosecutor and my deep understanding of law enforcement investigations.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg">
              Rather than merely responding to charges or reacting to the prosecution's moves, I begin every case by thinking strategically like a prosecutor and analytically like an investigator. I carefully reconstruct the police investigation, scrutinizing how evidence was collected and evaluating investigative methods. I identify any potential mistakes, oversights, or shortcuts taken by law enforcement and assess the reasoning behind prosecutorial charging decisions.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg">
              Before formulating a defense, I attempt to build the prosecution's case myself from their perspective. This reverse-engineering approach systematically reveals flaws in the evidence and investigative methods used by law enforcement. Only after this comprehensive analysis do I develop a customized defense strategy specifically designed to leverage those identified weaknesses, ensuring the best possible outcomes for my clients.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg">
              Additionally, I utilize proprietary artificial intelligence technology securely hosted on private servers. These sophisticated AI tools enable rapid and detailed evidence analysis, identify investigative gaps, and enhance the construction of clear, compelling courtroom arguments. All technological solutions adhere to strict standards of security and confidentiality.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg">
              Clients I represent benefit from an attorney who genuinely understands prosecution and investigative tactics from firsthand experience. This powerful combination of prosecutorial insight, investigative strategy, and advanced technology ensures robust and confident criminal defense representation.
